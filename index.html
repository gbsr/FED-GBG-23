				<h2>
					A conference for Frontend Developers, by Frontend
					Developers.
				</h2>
				<div class="p-strong">
					This year is all about Better Web&trade;
				</div>
				<p>
					For example, since some people have color-blindness, we've
					decided to include a ridiculous amount of colors in this
					landing page.
				</p>

				<p>
					You've probably noticed by now. That's all good and all.
					We've also included a small white text-shadow on the text to
					make it more legible.
				</p>
				<p>If you squint hard enough, I'm sure you can see it.</p>
				<p>See?</p>
				<h2>Better Web&trade; 2023</h2>

				<h1>
					Talks for this year is focused on accessibility, responsive
					design, and the most common layouts.
				</h1>
				<p>
					Of course, we don't care about the most common layouts,
					because why should we?
				</p>
				<p>
					We decided to go full on late 90's, early 2000 scrap book
					style instead, because.. why not?
				</p>

				<p>(Breaking the rules is ok)</p>
				<h2>
					Nevertheless, the talks we're hosting wants to make sure
					that we follow both the rules and the most common design
					principles, so get your ticket now and conform!
