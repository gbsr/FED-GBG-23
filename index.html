							A conference for Frontend Developers, by Frontend Developers.
						</h1>
						<h2>
							Get ready to dig deep into the beautiful world of Frontend Development
						</h2>

						<div class="spacer"></div>
						<p>
							In the small, beautiful, but very windy town of Gothenburg, Sweden, we
							are all about Accessibility this year. For example, since some people
							have color-blindness, we've decided for this years page to include a
							ridiculous amount of colors.
							<!-- (You can turn it off if you really want to though) -->
						</p>
						<p>
							This way we can (probably) deliver colors that everyone can appreciate!
						</p>
						<p>
							We've also included a small white text-shadow on the text to make it
							more legible. If you squint hard enough, I'm sure you can see it. Don't
							worry if you don't know what that means. This is we are here:
						</p>

						<h2>To help you level up your skills in Frontend Development</h2>
						<div class="spacer"></div>
						<p>
							A lot of things has happened in the past year with web development.
							React is becoming huge. threeJS is a thing. A lot of previous techniques
							that required JavaScript in order to function properly is now part of
							the standard CSS kit.
						</p>
						<p>
							However, this year we are going a different route. With all the new
							stuff coming out for us developers, it's important to take a step back
							and think about your users, and how they interact with your application.
							Are they using a mouse? Are they browsing on a phone? Are they not using
							a screen at all? This is why we have created a special conference this
							year.
						</p>
						<h1>
							Talks for this year is focused on accessibility, responsive design, and
							the most common layouts and UX patterns.
						</h1>
						<div class="spacer"></div>
						<p>
							Of course, we don't care about the most common layouts, because why
							should we? We decided to go full on late 90's, early 2000 scrap book
							style instead, because.. why not?
						</p>

						<h1 class="info">(Breaking the rules is ok)</h1>
						<h2>
							Nevertheless, the talks we're hosting is all about Better Web&#8482; and
							wants to make sure that we (or you, as it is) follow both the rules and
							the most common design principles, so get your ticket now, join the
							masses, and conform!

						<h2>
							FEX is a conference for Frontend Developers, meticulously crafted by
							Frontend Developers
						</h2>
						<p>
							As the creators of FEX (short for Frontend Expertise), we are very proud
							of our lineage. It all started as two developers started having
							Hackathons every other week. We sat in coffee-shops. We coded at bars.
							We spent time in each other's apartments.
						</p>
						<p>
							As time went by, more developers wanted to join and suddenly we realized
							that neither the apartments, the bars, nor the coffee-shops were big
							enough. Suddenly we had a bi-weekly meet-up and it was growing.
						</p>
						<div class="spacer"></div>
						<h2>We needed more.</h2>
						<h2>More space.</h2>
						<h2>More challenges.</h2>
						<h2>More people.</h2>
						<div class="spacer"></div>
						<p>
							As time went by we continued to grow, and so did our requirements. No
							longer was a bi-weekly hackathon a thing, where people gathered and
							created something random during 3 days time.
						</p>
						<p>
							People started to ask if they could hold seminars and talks about their
							creations. Participants started to join just to join for the talks, and
							not develop anything, as per the previous Hackathon 'rules'.
						</p>
						<div class="spacer"></div>
						<h1>This is when we knew we were on to something big</h1>
						<h1 class="title">FEX was finally born!</h1>
						<!-- <div class="spacer"></div> -->
						<h2>
							Our first ever real conference was held at Eriksbergs Conference Hall in
							2021, and hosted 25 talks and more than 500 visitors!
